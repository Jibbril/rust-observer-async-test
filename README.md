# Rust Observer Async Test
Dummy repo that creates a simple game to explore how the [observer pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer) can be implemented in Rust using `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. The game generates several random number generators that implement the `Subject` trait. A game board with several participants is then created that is passed as an observer to all of the random number generators. The generators will then begin generating numbers that will be randomly assigned to all of the participants in the game. Each time a generator adds a generates a number and the score is updated, the board standings are printed to the console.
